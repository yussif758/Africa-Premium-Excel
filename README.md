# Africa-Premium
## Background
You have been hired as a forecasting and budgeting analyst for “AfricaPremium,” a telecom company looking to enhance its financial planning and performance. The company has experienced steady growth over the past few years but now faces challenges with market saturation and increasing competition. Management expects you to refine the company's forecasting and budgeting processes to support strategic decision-making.

## Current Situation 
 Historical Performance: AfricaPremium has seen a 26% average annual revenue growth over the past three years, but the industry growth has been 35% over the past three years. 

Revenue Streams: The company generates revenue from Internet of Things plans, Fixed services, and value-added services. 

Market Conditions: Increasing competition from new entrants and changing customer preferences towards flexible and high-speed internet plans. 

Financial Data: Historical revenue and other KPIs(provided in the attached Excel workbook). AfricaPremium operates a January to December financial year cycle and is expected to grow at the same level as industry or even more for its next financial year.  

Strategy: AfricaPremium is aiming to reduce churn, increase new customers and remain dominant in the Telecom industry. 

## Task
Analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue and corresponding KPIs. 

Develop a forecast model for the next 12 months (Jan-25 to Dec-25), considering factors such as market conditions, growth initiatives, and potential risks. 

Introduce any missing KPIs which is needed for the forecast model. 

Explain the assumptions and methodologies used in your forecasting model. 

## Step by step Analysis
### Note :

The first thing i noticed is that even though AfricaPremimum has seen a positive average annual revenue growth of 26% over the years, indicating that AfricaPremimum is expanding and generating higher revenues over time. The industry is growing faster(35%), with a 9% growth gap (35% - 26%), which may indicate that AfricaPremium is losing relative competitiveness within the market. In order to further understrand why this is happening I have to analyze the historical revenue data. 

### - Analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue.
  Use the historical revenue data to identify trends in growth for each service line. To do this I created a line charts in Excel to visualize trends over time(3years).
