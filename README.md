Management expects you to refine the company's forecasting and budgeting processes to support strategic decision-making.

## Current Situation 
 Historical Performance: AfricaPremium has seen a 26% average annual revenue growth over the past three years, but the industry growth has been 35% over the past three years. 

Revenue Streams: The company generates revenue from Internet of Things plans, Fixed services, and value-added services. 

Market Conditions: Increasing competition from new entrants and changing customer preferences towards flexible and high-speed internet plans. 

Financial Data: Historical revenue and other KPIs(provided in the attached Excel workbook). AfricaPremium operates a January to December financial year cycle and is expected to grow at the same level as industry or even more for its next financial year.  

Strategy: AfricaPremium is aiming to reduce churn, increase new customers and remain dominant in the Telecom industry. 

## Task

## Step by step Analysis
### Note :

The first thing i noticed is that even though AfricaPremimum has seen a positive average annual revenue growth of 26% over the years, indicating that AfricaPremimum is expanding and generating higher revenues over time. The industry is growing faster(35%), with a 9% growth gap (35% - 26%), which may indicate that AfricaPremium is losing relative competitiveness within the market. In order to further understrand why this is happening I have to analyze the historical revenue data. 

### - Analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue.
  Use the historical revenue data to identify trends in growth for each service line. Firstly, I created a line charts in Excel to visualize trends over time(3years).

- We can see positve fluctuations in the monthly revenues for all revenue streams. This pattern indicates that revenue is increasing overall but experiencing periodic ups and downs.
- Despite the inconsistencies in growth, the overall trajectory is upward, indicating growth.
- The spikes and dips in monthly revenue might be caused by factors such as customer demands, promotions, discounts etc.

### Calculations 
### 1. Total Revenue
I then calculated the total revenue generated by each revenue stream over the past 3 years(2022-2024). This is to help me identify which streams contributed the most to the overal revenue generated over the years.

- We can clearly see that internet of things generated the most revenue as compared to the others. With fixed values contributing the least revenue over the years.
- Internest of things contributed about 2 times the amount generated from fixed values which generated the least revenue
