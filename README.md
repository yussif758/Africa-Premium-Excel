# Africa-Premium
## Background
You have been hired as a forecasting and budgeting analyst for “AfricaPremium,” a telecom company looking to enhance its financial planning and performance. The company has experienced steady growth over the past few years but now faces challenges with market saturation and increasing competition. Management expects you to refine the company's forecasting and budgeting processes to support strategic decision-making.

## Current Situation 
 Historical Performance: AfricaPremium has seen a 26% average annual revenue growth over the past three years, but the industry growth has been 35% over the past three years. 

Revenue Streams: The company generates revenue from Internet of Things plans, Fixed services, and value-added services. 

Market Conditions: Increasing competition from new entrants and changing customer preferences towards flexible and high-speed internet plans. 

Financial Data: Historical revenue and other KPIs(provided in the attached Excel workbook). AfricaPremium operates a January to December financial year cycle and is expected to grow at the same level as industry or even more for its next financial year.  

Strategy: AfricaPremium is aiming to reduce churn, increase new customers and remain dominant in the Telecom industry. 

## Task
Analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue and corresponding KPIs. 

Develop a forecast model for the next 12 months (Jan-25 to Dec-25), considering factors such as market conditions, growth initiatives, and potential risks. 

Introduce any missing KPIs which is needed for the forecast model. 

Explain the assumptions and methodologies used in your forecasting model. 

## Step by step Analysis
### Note :

The first thing i noticed is that even though AfricaPremimum has seen a positive average annual revenue growth of 26% over the years, indicating that AfricaPremimum is expanding and generating higher revenues over time. The industry is growing faster(35%), with a 9% growth gap (35% - 26%), which may indicate that AfricaPremium is losing relative competitiveness within the market. In order to further understrand why this is happening I have to analyze the historical revenue data. 

### - Analyze the historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue.
  Use the historical revenue data to identify trends in growth for each service line. Firstly, I created a line charts in Excel to visualize trends over time(3years).

- We can see positve fluctuations in the monthly revenues for all revenue streams. This pattern indicates that revenue is increasing overall but experiencing periodic ups and downs.
- Despite the inconsistencies in growth, the overall trajectory is upward, indicating growth.
- The spikes and dips in monthly revenue might be caused by factors such as customer demands, promotions, discounts etc.


### Calculations 
### 1. Growth Rates 
By calculating the monthly growth, i was able to see why the monthly revenue trend was fluctuating for eaxh stream. Fluctuating growth rates highlight the dynamic nature of business performance. By analyzing the underlying drivers and managing risks, the company can turn these fluctuations into opportunities for sustainable growth.

Formula:

Growth Rate = (Current Revenue - Previous Revenue) / Previous Revenue. 

or

Growth Rate = (Current Revenue / Previous Revenue) - 1

Format the cell to percentage.

- We can see that in some months, the growth rates reduced to negative causeing the revenues in those months to reduce drastically.
- The increase and decrease in growth rates might a results if customer behaviors or other factors. This is the reason the revenue has been fluctuating throughout the years.

- After calculating the monthly growth rate, I went ahead to calculate the yearly growth rates and hence find the average annual growth rate(AAGR) and the compound annual growth rate(CAGR). The values 26.26%, 25.98% respectively aligns with the 26% average annual revenue growth that was provided in the historical performance. This indicates that I'm on the right track.

Formulas :

AAGR = (=Average(all the yearly growth rates))

CAGR = (=((End year revenue/ Start year revenue)^(1/(Periods-1)) - 1)

### 2. Total Revenue
I then calculated the total revenue generated by each revenue stream over the past 3 years(2022-2024). This is to help me identify which streams contributed the most to the overal revenue generated over the years.

- We can clearly see that internet of things generated the most revenue as compared to the others. With fixed values contributing the least revenue over the years.
- Internest of things contributed about 2 times the amount generated from fixed values which generated the least revenue


### 3. Forecast
Since I was already given the average monthly growth rate for each revenue stream, I was able to use that to forecate the revenue for 2025. This was done by multiplying the revenue from the previous month by the average monthly growth rate to get the forecasted revenue. (Forecast Revenue = Previous Month Revenue x Average Monthly Growth Rate).

- We can see a consistent increase in all the revenue streams throughout 2025. This is because the growth rate for each stream was consistent through out the year. 				
- In 2025, internet of things generated the highest amount of revenue compared to the others				
-  Fixed and Value added services are slightly the same				



### 4. Yearly Total Revenue
I calculated the yearly total revenue for each revenue stream to verify if internet of things(IoT) generated the most revenue throughout the years or there were other streams that generated more revenue in some particular years than IoTs. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8749c84d-682b-4b4f-a8fc-c6f3992dd333" width="400" height="150" > <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/130aa8b7-d165-4b98-9cde-f22810c5613a" width="600" height="400" >
- The years(2022-2025) are represented by 1,2,3,4 respectively.					
- We can see that the revenue generated from all the streams increases continuously throughout the years even after the forecast. But it is different for Value added services because we saw a slight decrease between 2023 and 2024.
